.TH cfv 1 "05 Nov 2000"
.SH NAME
cfv \- Verify file concistency with .sfv, .csv, or md5sum files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cfv [-v|-V] [-r|-rr|-R] [-T|-C] [-m|-M] [-i|-I] [-u|-U] [--fixpaths <s>] [--showpaths <i>] [-t type] [-f file] [files...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cfv
verifies that the files you have are the same as those that the were used to create
the checksum file.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP "-v"
Enable printing of extra messages.
.IP "-V"
Disable printing of extra messages. (default)
.IP "-r"
Recursive mode 1.  In create mode, make seperate chksum files for each dir.
.IP "-rr"
Recursive mode 2.  In create mode make a single file with deep listing in it.
Both recursive modes are equivilant for test mode.
.IP "-R"
Disable recursive mode (default)
.IP "-T"
Set test mode. (default)
.IP "-C"
Set create mode.
.IP "-m"
Check only for missing files (don't compare checksums)
.IP "-M"
Check checksums (default)
.IP "-i"
Ignore case.  Currently has no effect in create mode.
.IP "-I"
Don't ignore case (default)
.IP "-u"
Show unverified files.  Currently has no effect in create mode.
.IP "-U"
Don't show unverified files (default)
.IP "--fixpaths string"
Convert all occurances of any characters in string to the dir seperator for the current platform.  No effect in create mode. Use an empty string to disable.
.IP "--showpaths int"
Show full paths 0:never, 1:always, 2:only in recursive mode(default)
.IP "-f file"
Specify the name of the checksum file to test or create.
.IP "-t type"
Specify the type of the file.  Can be sfv, csv, csv2, csv4, md5, or auto.  The default is auto,
which will detect the file type for you.  When creating, if type is auto an sfv
will be made, unless a different default has been set in the config file.
.P
.B sfv
is a simply file verify format file
.br
.B csv
is a comma seperated value file, with the fields being name,size,crc32,
.br
.B csv2
is a comma seperated value file, with the fields being name,size,
.br
.B md5
is md5sum format file
.SH NOTES
Since different platforms represent the path seperator differently, using recursive mode 2 (-rr) is not recommended for anything other than personal usage.  Although the addition of the fixpaths option can be used to work around this, it isn't guaranteed that whatever program others user have will have a similar feature.
.SH EXAMPLES
If no options are specified, the default will be -T -t auto, and it will search the current directory for any sfv, csv, or md5sum files.
.br
.B
cfv
.P
Force the file to test:
.br
.B
cfv -f funny.name
.P
Test only the files you have, (avoid file not found errors):
.br
.B
cfv *
.P
Create a csv file for all the files in the current dir:
.br
.B
cfv -C -tcsv
.P
Create a csv file for only the zip files in the current dir, and specify the filename:
.br
.B
cfv -C -tcsv -fsomezips.csv *.zip
.P
Check if all files in current and subdirs are verified, but don't verify checksums of files that are.  (For example, before writing a directory to a cdr and you want to make sure all the files are verified.):
.br
.B
cfv -r -m -u
.SH CONFIGURATION
Upon startup, cfv will test for ~/.cfvrc and if it exists, read configuration information from it.
The file consists of any number of lines, each having a single option name and the value seperated by a space.
Empty lines and lines beginning with a # are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
#this is an example .cfvrc that specifies all the default options
.br
#don't be verbose
.br
verbose 0
.br
#create sfv files by default
.br
default sfv
.br
#sort dir listings before creating a checksum file
.br
dirsort 1
.br
#sort command line specified files
.br
cmdlinesort 1
.br
#don't be recursive (set to 0 for -R,  1 for -r,  2 for -rr)
.br
recursive 0
.br
#don't show unverified files
.br
showunverified 0
.br
#don't ignore case
.br
ignorecase 0
.br
#don't fix any paths (note that there is a single space after fixpaths, thus the value it gets set to is an empty string)
.br
fixpaths 
.br
#show full paths in recursive mode (set to 0 for never, 1 for always, 2 for only in recursive mode)
.br
showpaths 2
.SH FILES
.PP
.IP "~/.cfvrc"
cfv configuration file.  See configuration section.
.SH BUGS
Specifying the [files...] arguments when using recursive test mode probably does not do what you want it to.  (Comments or suggestions on desired behavior welcome.)
.PP
Show unverified files does not work correctly with checksum files that have deep listings (ie, ones made with -rr).
