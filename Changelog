2001-0?-?? - v1.9:
	* Support bsd style md5 files (-t bsdmd5).  (requested by Felix Buenemann)
	* Make test.py not attempt to verify against md5sum if it is not available (ie, on bsd). (reported by Hannu Liljemark)
2001-05-17 - v1.8:
	* Fixed ignore case for deep (-rr) checksum files.
	* Added gzipped checksum file support.
	* Added change to directory first option (-p).
	* Makefile uses PYTHON var instead of hardcoded "python".
	* Added configurable renaming of bad files.
	* Extended --version output.
2001-02-27 - v1.7.2:
	* Fixed makefile not finding pkgdir if installing to /usr/local and no site-packages in /usr/local is in python's sys.path.
	* Added -q option.
	* Make exit status a bitwise or of the various possible error types.
	* Added cferror counter/exit status for unrecognized checksum files.
	* Catch errors opening checksum files and set cferror counter instead of exiting with unhandled exception.
	* Add error message for reading unrecognized lines in a checksum file, and set cferror counter.
	* Use Longs for per file sizes too, should be no large file issues anymore. (if you are using fchksum you should upgrade to 1.3 too.)
	* Time format uses .3 instead of .2 precision.
2001-02-22 - v1.7.1:
	* Fixed reading md5sum files that had dos eol on non-dos systems.
	* Loosened .sfv file recognition all the way.
	* Added --help alias for -h.
	* Added --version. 
2000-11-19 - v1.7:
	* Made ignore case option always search for correct filename if using show unverified files mode.  Fixes problem with incorrectly showing some files as unverified on FAT drives.
	* Caches dir entries for much faster ignore case operation.
	* Accepts - to represent stdin for data source and/or stdout for destination of checksums.
	* Added -VV option.
	* Errors printed to stderr instead of stdout.
	* Uses class instances instead of imp module for checksum types.
	* If using fchksum module, you now need at least version 1.2 (due to stdin ability).
2000-11-08 - v1.6:
	* Added ignore case option.
	* Added fix paths option.
	* Added handler for csv files with the dir seperate from the file name (-t csv4).
	* Makes any absolute paths found in checksum files into relative paths.
	* Added show paths option.
2000-10-17 - v1.5.2:
	* Added test suite.
	* Fixed 'x not in list' error when using -u and checksum file was not among the files to be tested. (First bug found with test suite ;)
	* Exits with non-zero status if any errors occured.
2000-10-12 - v1.5.1:
	* Fixed install wrapper stuff to compile _after_ it has been installed into the target dir.
2000-10-12 - v1.5:
	* Fixed "illegal argument type" error when creating csv format files.
	* Added note to manpage about -rr and path seperators.
	* Added show unverified files option.
	* Fixed md5 file testing when specifying files to test as command line args.
2000-10-05 - v1.4:
	* Added make install-wrapper option for faster startup times.
	* Uses long int value for total bytes read, to avoid overflow if you are checking a lot of files. (>=2GB, on 32bit archs)
	* Fixed divide by zero error on systems with lower resolution timers (ie, python-win32)
	* Ignore blank lines in .cfvrc
	* Loosened .sfv file recognition some more.
	* Handle error on creating/writing checksum file better.
	* Add handler for .csv files with no crc field (-t csv2).
2000-08-16 - v1.3:
	* .sfv file recognition loosened a bit (nvCRC32 says generated using instead of by)
	* uses fchksum module if available. (1.1x-2.0x faster)
2000-08-11 - v1.2:
	* recursive mode (-r and -rr)
	* only creates checksum file when there is actually something to put in it
	* if user doesn't specify files on command line, don't print errors about trying to add any directories and such
2000-07-10 - v1.1:
	* md5sum support (-t md5)
	* config file support
	* missing file only check (-m)
2000-06-22 - v1.0: first release
